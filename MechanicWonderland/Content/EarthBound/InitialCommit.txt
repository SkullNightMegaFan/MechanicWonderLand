I want to try making the teleport spell from EarthBound. If the player hits a wall or object while teleporting the spell will fail.
Just like earthbound there will be two versions of teloprt. the alpha and beta if I remember right. Where the character moves in a certain 
pattern and if that pattern is disrupted by any collision with an object the spell stops working. just seemed like a cool little thing.
